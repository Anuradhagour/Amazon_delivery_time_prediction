This project aims to predict delivery times for e-commerce orders based on a variety of factors such as product size, distance, traffic conditions, and shipping method.
Using the provided dataset, learners will preprocess, analyze, and build regression models to accurately estimate delivery times.
The final application will allow users to input relevant details and receive estimated delivery times via a user-friendly interface.

###Business Use Cases
Enhanced Delivery LogisticResults

###By the end of this project,we have:
A cleaned and processed dataset ready for modeling. 
Multiple regression models developed and tracked using MLflow. 
Insights into the factors influencing delivery times. 
A functional delivery time prediction system accessible via a Streamlit interface.
